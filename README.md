## Declarative Programming in Swift
Recently, a series of articles --- [Building a declarative animation framework in Swift](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/posts/building-a-declarative-animation-framework-in-swift-part-1) catches my eye. [John](https://twitter.com/johnsundell) points out a problem with implementing the animation in iOS, which is the more steps we add into our animation the more complex and hard to read our code becomes. Therefore, he creates a declarative way to deal with the animation, and it really makes our code more concise and readable. If you haven't read those articles, I highly recommend you should visit it.

### Notes
1. Readable, concise, expressiveness
2. What to do v.s. How to do it
3. Describe intentions
4. Idempotent
5. Concurrent
6. Stateless
7. Separation of concerns
8. Testability
